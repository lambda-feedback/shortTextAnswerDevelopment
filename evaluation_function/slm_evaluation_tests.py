#         Tests are used here to check that the algorithm written 
#         is working as it should. 
        
#         It's best practise to write these tests first to get a 
#         kind of 'specification' for how your algorithm should 
#         work, and you should run these tests before committing 
#         your code to AWS.

#         Read the docs on how to use unittest here:
#         https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

#         Use evaluation_function() to check your algorithm works 
#         as it should.
