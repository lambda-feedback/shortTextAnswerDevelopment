        Tests are used here to check that the algorithm written 
        is working as it should. 
        
        It's best practise to write these tests first to get a 
        kind of 'specification' for how your algorithm should 
        work, and you should run these tests before committing 
        your code to AWS.

        Read the docs on how to use unittest here:
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

        Use evaluation_function() to check your algorithm works 
        as it should.
